# Sheild-SQL
SHEILD_SQL By: Emmanuel Felix
For The Gordon Prize in Managing Cybersecurity Resources, 2024

Objective of the Project:
The main goal of the project is to enhance cybersecurity resource allocation by identifying vulnerabilities 
in SQL databases through automated testing. By utilizing this script, organizations can better allocate their 
cybersecurity resources towards identified vulnerabilities, thus improving their overall security posture. 
This is closely tied to economic aspects as effective vulnerability detection can significantly reduce the 
potential costs associated with data breaches and system downtimes.

Project Details:
The project focuses on SQL vulnerability scanning in URLs and forms, a crucial aspect of cybersecurity risk management.
The script employs Selenium for web automation, coupled with Python's requests library for HTTP requests in the website of
your choice. It simulates attacks (like SQL injections) to test the secuity level of database security. 

Anticipated Results:
The expected outcome of this project is the identification of SQL vulnerabilities in web applications. 
It should provide a clear assessment of potential security risks, enabling organizations to prioritize 
their cybersecurity efforts. The ultimate goal is to minimize the risk of data breaches and protect sensitive 
information, aligning with the economic objective of reducing the financial impact of cyber threats.

Originality:
This submission is original and has not been previously published and of my own work.

Relation to Cybersecurity Risk Management:
My project is a practical application in the domain of cybersecurity risk management. 
It focuses on proactive vulnerability identification, a key element in managing and mitigating cyber risks. 
By enabling efficient allocation of cybersecurity resources towards critical vulnerabilities, 
it contributes significantly to the broader field of cybersecurity.
